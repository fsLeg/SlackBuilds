Also known as Flash Player projector, SAFlashPlayer can play local SWF files
without using web browser with Adobe plugin.

Since binary is 32bit only, 64bit users must have multilib environment in
order to use this program.

Checksum in .info file is unreliable, because Adobe updates the tarball
without changing the link. This is also true for the program version.
