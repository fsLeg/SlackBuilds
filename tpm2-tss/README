OSS implementation of the TCG TPM2 Software Stack (TSS2).

TPM2.0 TSS (Software Stack) consists of API layers provided to support
TPM 2.0 chips. It is made out of three layers:

- Enhanced System API (ESAPI)
- System API (SAPI), which implements the system layer API;
- Marshaling/Unmarshaling (MU)
- TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI), which is used by SAPI to
  allow communication with the TAB/RM layer;

Before building tpm2-tss, please create a "tss" user and group:

  # groupadd -g 374 tss
  # useradd -g tss -u 374 -d /home/tss -M -s /bin/bash tss
