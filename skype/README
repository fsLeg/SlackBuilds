Skype is a free Voice Over IP program for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. It
allows users to communicate with other Skype users running any of the
supported platforms, as well as receiving and placing calls from and to
normal land lines and mobile phones.

This script repackages the shared tarball provided by Skype, which has
been built dynamically. Static binary support has been discontinued.

pulseaudio is an optional dependency.

If you don't want to install pulseaudio, but still want working sound,
you can build pulseaudio emulation library by specifying APULSE=yes.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
