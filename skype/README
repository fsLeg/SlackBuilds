Skype is a free Voice Over IP program for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. It
allows users to communicate with other Skype users running any of the
supported platforms, as well as receiving and placing calls from and to
normal land lines and mobile phones.

This script repackages the shared tarball provided by Skype, which has
been built dynamically. Static binary support has been discontinued.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
