Opera is the fastest and free (as in free beer) alternative browser.

This is a unified SlackBuild that can make packages for all three Opera flavors:
stable, beta and developer. By default stable version is built. If you want
other flavor, specify it in the FLAVOR variable. Possible values: "stable",
"beta" and "developer". Don't forget to adjust VERSION variable accordingly.

This package makes use of AlienBOB's chromium-pepperflash-plugin package. If you
have it installed, you'll have Adobe FlashPlayer.

By default Opera can only play WebM and Ogg Vorbis files in HTML5. To make it
play other formats as well you need FFmpeg libraries of specific version. If you
already have FFmpeg installed and it works with Opera, all is good. If not, you
can specify FFMPEG=yes to build local libraries that work with Opera. It is safe
for your FFmpeg installation, if you have one.

Sometimes different flavors of Opera require different FFmpeg versions. If
the flavor you chose doesn't support FFmpeg version in the SlackBuild, you
can specify a different version using FFMPEG_VERSION variable, i. e.
FFMPEG_VERSION=2.4.2

WARNING: this package (stable flavor) conflicts with classic Opera from SBo.
