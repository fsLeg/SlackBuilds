Opera is the fastest and free (as in free beer) alternative browser.

This is a unified SlackBuild that can make packages for all three Opera flavors:
stable (not yet released at the moment of writing), beta and developer. By
default beta version is built. If you want other flavor, specify it in a
FLAVOR variable. Possible values: "stable", "beta" and "developer". Don't
forget to adjust VERSION variable accrodingly.

This package makes use of AlienBOB's chromium-pepperflash-plugin package. If you
have it installed, you'll have Adobe FlashPlayer.

By default Opera can only play WebM and Ogg Vorbis files in HTML5. To make it
play other formats as well you need ffmpeg libraries of specific version. If you
already have ffmpeg installed and it works with Opera, all is good. If not, you
can specify FFMPEG=yes to build local libraries that work with Opera. It is safe
for your ffmpeg installation, if you have one.
