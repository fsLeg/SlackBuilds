OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is to be
a secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements the
OpenConnect SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental)
compatibility with clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol.
The OpenConnect VPN protocol uses the standard IETF security protocols
such as TLS 1.2, and Datagram TLS to provide the secure VPN service.
The server is implemented primarily for the GNU/Linux platform but its
code is designed to be portable to other UNIX variants as well.

Ocserv's main feature is isolation of the VPN users from the main VPN
server process. Each authenticated user is assigned an unprivileged
worker process, and a networking (tun) device. That not only eases the
control of the resources of each user or group of users, but also
prevents privilege escalation due to any bug on the VPN handling
(worker) server. Each VPN user can be authenticated using password,
PAM, public key (in a smart card or not) or any combination of methods.
