A Rust port of shadowsocks that superceded shadowsocks-libev.

Shadowsocks is a fast tunnel proxy that helps you bypass firewalls.

Since version 1.14.1 shadowsocks-rust requires `strip` function that
came in rust-1.59 which is newer than what Slackware 15 has, so
rust-for-mozilla from extra/ is required to build the package.

This SlackBuild downloads nessessary crates to build the binaries,
so internet connection is required. Then again, if you're going to
use Shadowsocks, it shouldn't be a problem.
