A Rust port of shadowsocks that superceded shadowsocks-libev.

Shadowsocks is a fast tunnel proxy that helps you bypass firewalls.

This SlackBuild downloads nessessary crates to build the binaries,
so internet connection is required. Then again, if you're going to
use Shadowsocks, it shouldn't be a problem.
