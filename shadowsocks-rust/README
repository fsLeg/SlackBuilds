A Rust port of shadowsocks that superceded shadowsocks-libev.

Shadowsocks is a fast tunnel proxy that helps you bypass firewalls.

rust >=1.70 from extra/ is required to build this package.

This SlackBuild downloads nessessary crates to build the binaries,
so internet connection is required. Then again, if you're going to
use Shadowsocks, it shouldn't be a problem.
