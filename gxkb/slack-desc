# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gxkb: gxkb (X11 keyboard indicator and switcher)
gxkb:
gxkb: gxkb is a little indicator applet which allows one to quickly switch
gxkb: between different keyboard layouts in X. A flag corresponding to the 
gxkb: country of the active layout is shown in the indicator area.
gxkb:
gxkb: The applet is written in C and uses the GTK+ library and therefore
gxkb: does not depend on any GNOME components.
