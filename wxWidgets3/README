wxWidgets is a C++ library that lets developers create applications
for Windows, OS X, Linux and UNIX on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures
as well as several mobile platforms including Windows Mobile, iPhone
SDK and embedded GTK+.

This script will build the package that can be installed alongside with
wxWidgets 2.8. If you need to build a program against this version, use
--with-wx-config=wx-config-3.0 configure option or something similar.
Alternatively, rename wx-config from 2.8 to wx-config-2.8 and use symlinks
to manage your version.
