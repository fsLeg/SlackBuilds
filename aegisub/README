Aegisub is a free, cross-platform open source tool for creating and
modifying subtitles. Aegisub makes it quick and easy to time subtitles
to audio, and features many powerful tools for styling them, including
a built-in real-time video preview.

pulseaudio, openal, portaudio are optional dependencies.

If you want bleeding edge Aegisub, get git tree tarball and define
VERSION variable as "git". Be warned that it might not build.
