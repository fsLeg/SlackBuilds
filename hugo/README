Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is
optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a
directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML
website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you
can run Hugo from any directory. This works well for shared hosts and
other systems where you donâ€™t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a
second. A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in
around 1 millisecond.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs,
tumbles, and docs.

By default the extended version with deployment support is built. The
extended version adds support for WebP image encoding and SASS
processing. The deployment support allows you to deploy your website to
Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. To build just
the core version use:

    EXTENDED=no DEPLOY=no ./hugo.SlackBuild

dart-sass is an optional runtime dependency. It'll be used for SASS
processing regardless of version built.
